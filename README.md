MCSim
=====

An R package for metacommunity simulations and functions to calculate biodiversity metrics

Details and a tutorial for MCSim are currently available at https://sites.google.com/site/metacommunitysimulation/. We will have a publication coming out in Ecological Modelling that illustrates how MCSim can be applied to understand spatial patterns in a zooplankton metacommunity with example R code. 

Please feel free to email me with questions, suggestions, etc.
